# MVC in Drupal 8: Getting closer
## What is MVC: the elevator pitch

Just like it's no longer considered good web engineering to use inline styles exclusively, or have business logic &  database queries next to the display logic - it's no longer best practice to intermingle logic, display, & data storage. Separating these layers mean that they can be tested in isolation, making debugging and long term maintenance less of an issue.

## What's so special about D8?
### CMI
### WSCCI
### VDC
